# Arithmetic Expression Compiler with Assembly Code Generation 🚀

## Overview 💡

This project is a simple arithmetic expression evaluator that parses a mathematical expression, converts it into assembly-like code, and evaluates the result. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handles edge cases such as division by zero. The program uses **infix-to-postfix conversion** and **assembly code generation** to simulate register operations.

## Features ✨

- ✅ **Arithmetic Expression Evaluation**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 🛠️ **Assembly Code Generation**: Generates assembly-like instructions for each operation.
- 🚫 **Division by Zero Handling**: Detects division by zero and outputs "undefined".
- 🧩 **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Uses the Shunting Yard algorithm for expression parsing.

## How to Use 🖥️

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arithmetic-expression-compiler.git
   cd arithmetic-expression-compiler
Compile the Code: Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed. To compile the program:

gcc -o compiler compiler.c
Run the Program: Execute the compiled program:
./compiler
Enter an Expression: The program will prompt you to enter an arithmetic expression in the form of result = a + b. You can enter expressions with numbers and basic arithmetic operations.

Example input:

result = 2 + 3
The program will generate corresponding assembly code and display the actual result.

Example 🎯
Input:
result = 2 + 3
Output:
MOV R1, 2
MOV R2, 3
ADD R3, R1, R2
MOV result, R3
Actual Result: 5
Input (with division by zero):

result = 10 / 0
Output:
MOV R1, 10
MOV R2, 0
DIV R3, R1, R2
MOV result, R3
Result: undefined (division by zero)
How it Works 🔧
Tokenization:
The input expression is split into tokens such as variables, numbers, operators, and parentheses.
Infix to Postfix Conversion:
The infix expression is converted to postfix using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
Assembly Code Generation:
The postfix expression is processed to generate assembly code with register-based operations (MOV, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV).
Expression Evaluation:
The postfix expression is evaluated using a stack, with division by zero being specially handled.
Edge Cases ⚠️
Division by Zero: The program detects division by zero and outputs an "undefined" result.
Invalid Expressions: The program will report errors for mismatched parentheses, unsupported tokens, and missing operands.
